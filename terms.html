                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary font-medium">17.1 Generally.</p>
                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary">
                     In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Curriki in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Curriki agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration.
                     Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators
                     can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
                     misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CURRIKI ARE EACH WAIVING THE
                     RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
                  </p>
                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary font-medium">17.2 Exceptions.</p>
                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary">
                     Despite the provisions of Section 17.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action
                     through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary">
                     Any arbitration between you and Curriki will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA
                     Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by
                     contacting Curriki.

                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary font-medium">17.4 Notice; Process.</p>
                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary">
                     A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current
                     physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). Curriki’s address for Notice is: Curriki 20660 Stevens Creek Boulevard #332 Cupertino, CA 95014. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b)
                     set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Curriki
                     may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Curriki must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If
                     the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Curriki will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Curriki in
                     settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.
                  </p>
                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary font-medium">17.5 Fees.</p>
                  <p class="font-size-16 font-theme-secondary font-theme-color-secondary">
                     If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Curriki will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA
                     Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the
                     basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator
                     finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of
                     all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Curriki for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the
                     arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and
                     resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

                     YOU AND CURRIKI AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and
                     Curriki agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

                     Notice, in which case your account with Curriki will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
