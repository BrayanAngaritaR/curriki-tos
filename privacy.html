                     Curriki is not directed to children under 13. While a child under 13 is not technically constrained from creating an account, we don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 online or offline or display advertisements to them. Similarly, we don’t obtain verifiable parental consent, provide parents with direct notice, or get their consent to use data for “internal operations” under COPPA. Because we don’t provide the Services to children under 13, we don’t restrict their purchases or activity on the Services or participate in any FTC safe harbor program.

We will respond to all requests from parents, guardians, or others to prevent further collection of any child’s information.

                     Note that Curriki provides a way for educators and parents to share and access educational materials for K-12 school purposes. It does NOT collect student education records or students’ personal information. No such data is entered into Curriki’s Services. Thus, Curriki necessarily does not provide a way for students to review such information; does not take any steps to ensure the accuracy of such information; does not have a process for schools, parents, or students to modify such information; does not allow schools, parents, or students to submit requests to modify such information; and has no deadline for making such modifications. Similarly, there is no behavioral or contextual advertising based on student data and third parties cannot use such data to create profiles or otherwise use such data to target advertising to students, parents, teachers, or schools.
